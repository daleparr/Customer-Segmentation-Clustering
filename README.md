# Customer-Segmentation-Clustering

# Customer Segmentation with Clustering

## Project Overview
This project aims to segment customers based on their purchasing behaviors to improve marketing strategies and customer engagement. By leveraging clustering techniques, we identify distinct customer groups that businesses can target effectively.

```

## Step 1: Data Preprocessing
```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Load Data
data = pd.read_csv('data/customer_data.csv')

# Aggregate at customer level
data_agg = data.groupby('CustomerID').agg({
    'PurchaseAmount': 'sum',
    'PurchaseFrequency': 'count',
    'Recency': 'min',
    'AvgUnitCost': 'mean'
}).reset_index()

# Standardize Data
scaler = StandardScaler()
data_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(data_agg.iloc[:, 1:])
```

## Step 2: Clustering Analysis
```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Elbow Method for Optimal Clusters
wcss = []
for i in range(2, 10):
    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=i, random_state=42)
    kmeans.fit(data_scaled)
    wcss.append(kmeans.inertia_)

plt.plot(range(2, 10), wcss, marker='o')
plt.xlabel('Number of Clusters')
plt.ylabel('WCSS')
plt.title('Elbow Method for Optimal K')
plt.show()

# Apply KMeans
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=4, random_state=42)
data_agg['Cluster'] = kmeans.fit_predict(data_scaled)
```

## Step 3: Business Insights
```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Visualize Cluster Characteristics
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
sns.boxplot(x='Cluster', y='PurchaseAmount', data=data_agg)
plt.title('Cluster-wise Purchase Amount Distribution')
plt.show()

plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
sns.boxplot(x='Cluster', y='Recency', data=data_agg)
plt.title('Cluster-wise Recency Distribution')
plt.show()

# Cluster Analysis
print(data_agg.groupby('Cluster').mean())

# Recommendations
recommendations = {
    0: "Cluster 0: High Recency, Low Frequency & CLV - Implement loyalty programs.",
    1: "Cluster 1: High Frequency, Moderate CLV & Revenue - Upselling & personalized offers.",
    2: "Cluster 2: High CLV, High Frequency - VIP programs and premium services.",
    3: "Cluster 3: Low Recency, Low Frequency - Reactivation campaigns."
}

for cluster, message in recommendations.items():
    print(message)
```

## Step 4: Business Impact
By leveraging customer segmentation, businesses can achieve the following outcomes:

1. **Improved Marketing Efficiency**: By targeting each customer segment with personalized promotions, businesses can optimize marketing spend, reduce customer acquisition costs, and improve conversion rates.
2. **Increased Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**: Understanding customer behaviors allows companies to tailor retention strategies, increasing repeat purchases and maximizing CLV.
3. **Better Inventory Management**: Insights from clustering can help businesses align stock levels with demand patterns, reducing overstocking and minimizing lost sales due to out-of-stock situations.
4. **Optimized Pricing Strategies**: By identifying high-value and price-sensitive customer groups, businesses can implement dynamic pricing strategies that maximize profitability.
5. **Enhanced Customer Experience**: Tailored loyalty programs, personalized recommendations, and targeted communications improve overall customer satisfaction and brand loyalty.
6. **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Businesses can transition from instinct-driven marketing to actionable, data-backed strategies that drive measurable impact.

## Step 5: Future Improvements
- **Predictive CLV Modeling**: Implement machine learning models to predict future CLV for better decision-making.
- **A/B Testing**: Run experiments on marketing campaigns tailored to each cluster.
- **Real-time Segmentation**: Introduce automated real-time customer segmentation using streaming data.

This repository provides a solid foundation for businesses looking to leverage clustering for customer insights and engagement strategies.
